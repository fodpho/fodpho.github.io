This is the blog where I store my tech archives and practice Web designing skills when I am not busy. The blog is based on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/); the layout is mainly inspired by [Hux Blog](https://huangxuan.me/). Other great projects such as [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) also helped me a lot.
